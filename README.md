### Frontend Development Cycle with Vue JS

#### Preliminary Steps:

1. Clone this repository on your local machine

2. Ensure that the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed

3. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory

4. Run the following command

```
npm install
```

#### Frontend Development Cycle:

1. Make a branch from the main branch to develop your work

2. Make all of your changes

3. Test your changes in real-time by navigating to `frontend/` and running the below command. It will provide you with an IP address to a website hosted locally on your machine, which you can enter into your web browser to check changes in real-time.

```
npm run dev
```

4. Need to fully build a production version of the frontend? Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run:

```
npm run build
```

5. Commit and push your changes to your development branch

6. If we all agree with the changes, we can merge those changes in the development branch into the main branch
